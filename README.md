## Description

This project is a dynamically populating team generator. I learned how to use object oriented programming in Javascript with this assignment. The thing I'm most proud of for this project is that it did not take me as long as I thought it would have to create the test files and be able to pass them. In the future I'd like to be able to integrate this site with a backend database so that each time it is generated a file on the computer does not grow.
